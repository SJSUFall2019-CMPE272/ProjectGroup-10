# Smart MOM (Minutes of Meeting)

## Description: 
This model will record the meetings either through a recorder or as an Alexa Skill and convert the audio to text. The meeting conversation will be classified into a proper conversation. This conversation will be passed through various NLP algorithms to create a summary and generate minutes of meeting automatically. These minutes of meeting will be send over to all stakeholders especially the ones who couldn't attend the meeting. 

# Abstract:

This is a smart assistant to help user go through minutes of meeting in such a way that user gets meeting summary generated by a tool that picks up only relevant information to agenda of meeting and discards any unnecessary information. This model is most useful in all types of enterprises where any employee who misses the meeting is always up to date with the meeting contents.
